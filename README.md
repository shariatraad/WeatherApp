# üå§Ô∏è WeatherApp

This Android application, built with Java and Android Studio, offers detailed weather forecasts for various locations worldwide. The app provides weather information for the current day and several days ahead, displaying data such as:

- Current temperature
- Sunrise and sunset times
- Lowest and highest temperatures
- Precipitation

By enabling users to search for a city, they can receive accurate and up-to-date weather information. This project serves as a foundation for integrating weather forecasts and Google APIs, providing a baseline for developers to build upon.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of Android Studio.
- You have installed the appropriate version of the Java Development Kit (JDK).
- You have registered on WeatherBit.io and Google Places to obtain API keys.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to get API keys from WeatherBit.io and Google Places. Follow these steps:

1. Go to [WeatherBit.io](https://www.weatherbit.io/account/create) and create an account (if you don't already have one). Once logged in, navigate to the API keys section and generate a new API key.

2. Next, go to the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Create a new project (if you don't have one already), enable the Places API in the library section, and then create credentials for your project to get the API key.

After you've obtained both API keys, you will need to add them to your `gradle.properties` file. If it doesn't exist, create one in the root directory of your project and insert the keys in the following way:

```properties
API_KEY_WEATHER = "your-weatherbit-api-key"
API_KEY_PLACES = "your-google-places-api-key"
```

Then, you can access these keys in the `Constants` class using the `BuildConfig` class, which Gradle automatically generates:

```java
public class Constants {
    public static final String API_KEY_WEATHER = BuildConfig.API_KEY_WEATHER;
    public static final String API_KEY_PLACES = BuildConfig.API_KEY_PLACES;
    // ...
}
```

## üß© Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Run the project on the emulator or an actual device.

You'll be asked to grant location permissions upon launching the application for the first time. The app uses these permissions to display your location's current weather and forecast. Additionally, you can search for other cities. Enter the city name in the search bar to get the current weather and forecast for the next few days in that city.
